# WIIFM

Web Developers need to be able to write conditional statements and they also need to create reusable and maintainable code with functions.

# Overview

Prompts will be given to write small programs which will include conditional statements and function.

# Learning Objectives

- Understanding what a statement is 
- Understanding what a conditional control structure is 
- Creating reusable code with functions 
- Functions can take values, return values, or do both 

# Slide Deck should include
- progams have statements 
- statements can define something

- statements can do something
  conole.log('hello');
- functions allow us to reuse statements
- function can also take values which are called parameters
- functions can return values

# WIIFM

Web Developers will often have to use and construct objects in order to engineer solutions. 

# Overview

Short prompts will be used to cover the underlying concepts followed by a demo which utilizes several concepts which will be similar to the workshop prompt(s).

# Learning Objectives
- Understanding how to create objects
- Getting and setting values of objects
- Iterating over the keys of an object with a for in loop
- Object methods, keys, values, and entries
- Passing objects to functions
- Creating objects with functions
- Modifying an object with functions


# Slide Deck should include
- arrays are objects
- objects are objects
- objects are made of keys and values
- unlike arrays objects are not orderered
- you can iterate over an object with a for in loop
- The Object object has methods keys, values, and entries which can used to get an objects keys, values, or entries

# WIIFM

Web developers need to be able to write programs which manipulate the user interfaces.

# Overview

User interfaces will change depending on underlying data. When the data changes, the interface will be re-rendered.

# Learning Objectives

- Understanding the relationship between the user interface and JavaScript.
- Understanding the data -> UI lifecycle
- Being able to select DOM elements.

# WIIFM

Web developers need to be able to write programs which fetch data from RESTFUL endpoints.

# Overview

User interfaces will be rendered from data which is fetched from another server using the fetch API.

# Learning Objectives

- Understanding how external RESTFUL api's can be leveraged in order use third party data.
- Knowing how the combination of verbs and URL's of a restful API indicate the function of the enpoints
- Understanding the role the fetch API plays in fetching third part data. 
- Creating a webpage which displays data from a third party RESTFUL api. 

# Slide Deck should include

- The data to UI paradigm
- RESTFUL API's -> URL's which have data
- RESTFUL - Representational state transfer, by knowing the verb and the URL, we can often infer the role of various endpoints.
- Eventually - we will create our own API's.
- Can we display some examples? pokemon, etc
- Getting RESTFUL data - the fetch API
- Link for fetch api documentation
- fetch API - promises -> async / await
- the idea that no matter how fast fetch is, the code after await will only occur after other code is called (this is the event loop, but not sure we need to call it the event loop)
- fetch API -> data -> rendered UI
- RESTFUL API's return data in different formats. If documentation exists, read it, if not, call it and see how the data is returned.
- RESTFUL API's and JSON data
- JSON vs. objects

# Utilizes

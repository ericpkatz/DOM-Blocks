- you've been tasked to build a single page application for the folks at puppy bowl
- you have been provided the endpoint below https://fsa-puppy-bowl.herokuapp.com/api/MY_COHORT/players
- The goal is to take the data at that endpoint and allow users to filter the players whose names start with each letter of the alphabet
- The UI should have all the letters of the alphabet as links.
- When a link is clicked, the url should change, and all the players whose name begins with that letter should be displayed.
- The link which is currently active should be highlighted as well
- If the highlighted link is clicked, it should update the hash, so that no players are shown below the links
- All letters should be shown as links, but only links which have players associated to them should be shown.
